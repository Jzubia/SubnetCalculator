# SubnetCalculators
During my time at my Internship at Computex, I picked up on the concept of subnetting. Inspired by these computations and to get familiar with PowerShell, I decided to create my own Subnet Calculator! (As well as a SubnetMask to CIDR notation calculator)

I'm including the source code inside of a folder called "IPCalculator".

The full code is available in a single file called "RunCalc". This was used to create the .exe file called "SubnetCalculator.exe".

The Submask Converter source code is within "MasktoCIDR". The .exe file for this converter is called "SubMaskConv.exe".

All .exe files will be grouped in the "executables" folder.

Enjoyed working on this :)

**Final Note**
** If you are using individual files in the "IPCalculator" folder, you'll need to change the file paths when .\ the other scripts. **
